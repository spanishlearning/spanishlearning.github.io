                <h1>About Learning Spanish</h1>
                <p>My name is Christian.<br />I am a Spanish professor with a master degree in Language and 15 years of professional experience teaching Spanish and editing books in Spanish in Argentina and the United States.<br />I speak English and Italian.</p>
                <p>My One-to-One Spanish Program includes private lessons tailored to meet the needs and goals of each student.<br />The individual nature of these courses allows students to progress quickly and to develop their Spanish language skills with confidence.</p>

                <p>Why me?<br />There are many English teachers teaching Spanish in Buenos Aires, but I am Spanish professor with a degree in SPANISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE.<br />It means, I have the qualifications to teach Spanish for foreigners.</p>

                <p>If you are interested, please, send me an email and let me know how many hours do you want to take, where are you from and where do you live in Buenos Aires.<br />I'll send all information about the best program for you.<br />Payment: cash pesos, dollars or euros or by credit card.</p>
